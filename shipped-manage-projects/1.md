#<a name="create"></a>Create a Project

1. Within the Shipped UI, go to **My Projects > Create New Project**.

	The **Create Your Project** form opens.

2. Enter a name for your project, then click **Start Composing**.

	A project name can only consist of letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, but no spaces.

	Shipped builds some basic components, then shows the **Compose Your Project** page.

	If using windows, install the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases"  target="_blank">Git Credential Manager for Windows</a> into the Shipped directory.

	Shipped automatically downloads and installs apps needed for your project. This might take a couple of minutes.


After creating a project, you can Deploy it.
