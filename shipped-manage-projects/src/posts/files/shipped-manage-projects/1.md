#<a name="create"></a>Create a Project using the UI

1. Within the Shipped UI, go to **My Projects > Create New Project**.

	The **Create Your Project** form opens.

	<video poster="assets/create-project.png" width="480" height="300" none controls> <source src="assets/shipped-new-project.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

2. Enter a name for your project, then click **Start Composing**.

	A project name can only consist of letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, but no spaces.

	Shipped builds some basic components, then shows the **Compose Your Project** page.

5. Click **Build Project**.

	Follow the instructions shown in the UI, copying and pasting the commands into the local directory you want to use for your Shipped project.

	This example shows a project created in Windows.

	If using windows, install the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases"  target="_blank">Git Credential Manager for Windows</a> into the Shipped directory.

	Shipped automatically downloads and installs apps needed for your project. This might take a couple of minutes.








##Create a Project using the API

To create a project, provide a project name.

For example,

	curl https://api.ciscoshipped.io/projects -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '{'"name":"myproject"}'

HTTP request:
	
	POST https://api.ciscoshipped.io/projects







##Create a Project using the CLI

Within the Shipped Console:

To create a project, use *create* and provide the project name. The description is optional.

	project create name="<project name>" description="<description>"

*-or-*

	project create name="MyProject" description="A sample project"

*-or-*

	pr cr n="MyProject" d="A sample project"
