#Delete a Project

Deleting a project stops all services, but only removes the Project files, and not any associated files, such as Users or Repositories.

Deleting a Project is permanent and can't be undone, although you can always create a new Project and start over.

Projects can't be deleted from the UI, but can be deleted using the API or the CLI.


##Delete a Project using the API
Remember, this action is permanent and can't be undone.

To delete a project, specify the project ID, then use *DELETE*.

For example,

	curl https://api.ciscoshipped.io/projects/b475996d-dd1e-11e4-9917-0090f5d8986c -X DELETE

HTTP request:
	
	DELETE https://api.ciscoshipped.io/projects/<PROJECT_ID>


##Delete a Project using the CLI
Remember, this action is permanent and can't be undone.

To delete a project, specify the project ID, then use *delete*.

	shipped pr del %demo

A Delete Confirmation message comes up. Type **Y** to continue.
