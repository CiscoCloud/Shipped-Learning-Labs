## Check the Service using the UI

Shipped automatically checks to see if the service is ready. If ready, a success message appears. If not, instructions on what to do next are shown.




## Check the Service using the API

This feature has not been implemented.



## Check the Service using the CLI

Within the Shipped Console:

To check a service, use *check* with the service and project IDs. If the service ID is omitted, all services are checked. You can navigate to the project directory to avoid specifying the project ID.


	service check <projectId> <serviceId>

*-or-*

	svc check 183d5961-71f5-11e5-b058-0242ac110238 271c696b-7360-11e5-9240-0242ac11026c
