## Create a Service using the UI







## Create a Service  using the API

To create a service, specify the project ID.

Optional arguments are:

- *buildPackID* - The ID of the buildpack to use for the service. If buildPackId is omitted, DeployImage must be provided.
- *BootstrapTemplateRepo* - The GitHub repository that hosts a sample hello-world implementation to use for a new service. 
- *BuildCommand* - The shell command to build the service.
- *BuildImage* - Build image used when building a service to be tested with Drone. 
- *ContainerPort* - The container port used by Docker for this service.
- *ContainerSharedDirectory* - The location within the Docker container that will be shared with the host. 
- *CPU* - The number of CPUs required for the service.
- *Deployimage* - The image (usually found at registry.hub.docker.com) of the Docker container in which to run.
- *EnvVariables* -  One or more environment variables to set in the service container.  Specify as a comma-separated list in the form env="name1:var1,name2:var2".
- *ImageSource* - A URL for an image used by this service. 
- *Organization* - The name of the organization.
- *Public* - Whether or not repository should be public (default true).
- *RAM* - The amount of RAM required for the service.
- *Repository* - The GitHub repository for the service in the form https://github.com/username/reponame (will be created if it doesn’t already exist).
- *RunCommand* - The shell command to run the service.
- *TestCommand* - The shell command to run tests for the service.


For example,

	curl 'https://api.ciscoshipped.io/projects/19d87036-532a-11e5-913f-0242ac1100c4/services' -d '{"type": "ServiceRepo", "project_id":"34a35726-66e9-11e5-99df-0242ac110120","buildpack_id":"4e0c194a-1c66-11e5-bb2c-a45e60e7c003","name":"rails","public":true,"organization":""}'

HTTP request:

	POST https://api.ciscoshipped.io/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/services






## Create a Service  using the CLI

To create a service, use *create* with the name of the service and the project ID. Or you can navigate to the project directory to avoid specifying the project ID.

Optional arguments are:

- *buildPackID* - The ID of the buildpack to use for the service. If buildPackId is omitted, DeployImage must be provided.
- *BootstrapTemplateRepo* - The GitHub repository that hosts a sample hello-world implementation to use for a new service. 
- *BuildCommand* - The shell command to build the service.
- *BuildImage* - Build image used when building a service to be tested with Drone. 
- *ContainerPort* - The container port used by Docker for this service.
- *ContainerSharedDirectory* - The location within the Docker container that will be shared with the host. 
- *CPU* - The number of CPUs required for the service.
- *Deployimage* - The image (usually found at registry.hub.docker.com) of the Docker container in which to run.
- *EnvVariables* -  One or more environment variables to set in the service container.  Specify as a comma-separated list in the form env="name1:var1,name2:var2".
- *ImageSource* - A URL for an image used by this service. 
- *Organization* - The name of the organization.
- *Public* - Whether or not repository should be public (default true).
- *RAM* - The amount of RAM required for the service.
- *Repository* - The GitHub repository for the service in the form https://github.com/username/reponame (will be created if it doesn’t already exist).
- *RunCommand* - The shell command to run the service.
- *TestCommand* - The shell command to run tests for the service.
