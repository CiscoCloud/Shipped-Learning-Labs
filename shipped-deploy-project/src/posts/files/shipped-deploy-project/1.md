# Shipped - Deploying a Project

Projects are deploying using Deploy Targets. Deploy targets are the cloud or on-premise clusters where you provision your Shipped services. Cisco runs public targets, but you can  add your own public or private targets.

A release is a build deployed to a specific environment for a service.
