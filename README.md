### Contributing

1. To contribute, fork then clone this project.
2. Consider these guidelines:

	- Use a descriptive title, one main topic per page.
	- Keep the content relevant to the title. If you find you have a lot of side notes and extraneous information, consider creating another topic.
	- State the most important content first.
	- Instructions that are easiest to understand are brief, simple, and focused. Often, users don't need the backstory to accomplish a simple task. Consider a separate topic for further explanations. Use details wisely. Avoid padding.
	- Place images and screenshots after the explanation. Do not use captions.
	- Write using the active voice. For example: 
		- **PASSIVE**. The feedthrough was composed of a sapphire optical fiber, which was pressed against the pyrotechnic that was used to confine the charge.
		- **ACTIVE**. The feedthrough contained a sapphire optical fiber, which pressed against the pyrotechnic containing the charge.
	5. Avoid jargon.
	6. Test out the instructions yourself. Ensure the steps are complete (but brief!).
