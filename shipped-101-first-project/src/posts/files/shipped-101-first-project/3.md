## Add Microservices

## Choose a Repository
Enter a name for the repository for the Docker image that will be created as a part of this project. I am going to choose shipped101helloworld. As I have a free account on GitHub, my only choice is to choose "Public". I will then click "Add Microservices" to continue; Today I only want to add one microservice so I will continue by choosing "Next Step"
