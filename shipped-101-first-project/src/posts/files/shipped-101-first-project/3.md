# Step 4. Interacting with Vagrant #

#### Restarting Vagrant with our new source files
Lets confirm we are in the the Docker directory where you created your main.go and test.sh file by issuing command "ls".  

<pre>$ ls
Dockerfile	main.go		test.sh
</pre></li>

Now change directory up one to the parent directory which is our top level project directory by issuing command "cd ..". 

<pre>$ cd ..</pre></li>

You should now be at your top level project folder.

Change into a hidden subdirectory called .shipped by issuing this command "cd .shipped". Issuing the command "ls" will confirm that there is a file called Vagrantfile in this directory.

<pre>$ cd .shipped
$ ls
Vagrantfile
</pre></li>

When view the contents of the Vagrantfile by issuing command "cat Vagrantfile" you may see these two lines which affect port mapping. 

<pre>$ cat Vagrantfile
</pre></li>

Note port 8888 is the port your golang file is listening on. Port 38888 is the local port being mapped to port 8888 when your application is running in Docker:
        d.ports = ["38888:8888"]
        d.name = "shipped101helloworld"
  	  
To reload Vagrant now that you have added source code to your project, issue the command "vagrant reload". You will see vagrant reload your project.

<pre>$ vagrant reload
</pre></li>

Now, to verify it is running properly, execute your test script by issuing the command "../helloworldgoLang/test.sh 38888". 

<pre>$ ../helloworldgoLang/test.sh 38888
</pre></li>

If things are working properly you should see the message OKAY, else you should see NOT OKAY as the response;

When you are finished, you can issue the command "vagrant halt" to halt the virtual machine.

<pre>$ vagrant halt
</pre></li>

#### Pushing your changes to Shipped

Let's save our changes into GitHub which will cause them to be published to Shipped as well.

Issue the command "cd ../shipped101helloworld" to change to our souce directory.

<pre>$ cd ../shipped101helloworld
</pre></li>

Now add all our changes to our git change list by issuing command "git add -A"
<pre>$ git add -A
</pre></li>
Next lets commit them to our local storage by issuing command "git commit"
<pre>$ git commit -m "first first shipped commit for shipped project 101"
</pre></li>
Now push them up to the GitHub repository and notify Shipped by issuing command "git push origin master"

<pre>$ git push origin master
</pre></li>

#### Summary of our progress

To summarize, we have now bootstrapped our local development environment from the url received from Shipped, added our source code and test script, validated it locally in Vagrant and pushed our changes up to GitHub and Shipped.

In our learning module, we will learn how to validate and deploy our project in Shipped in a continuous integration pattern.

## Creating an Environment

Once you have submitted your code back to Shipped, and it has built successfully you will want to create a virtual environment to deploy it into. 

Typically you will create a staging environment to initially deploy it to. Once you have met your ship requirements and have a stable build which has been verified in staging, then you are ready to deploy it to a production environment.

The great thing about Shipped is that your development environment, your staging environment, and your production environment can be virtually the same (no pun intended) thanks to Vagrant, Virtual Box, and Docker!

Initially you will have no environments created. Clicking "Create New Environment" will create one for you. All you do is have to enter the name and description for your environment and click "Add Environment".

## Deploying Build to Environment

Deploying a build to an environment means that the project you have been working on will be deployed to the environment you select. It will replace any previous deployment of the build to that environment. A staging environment is a good place to practice with.

To deploy a build to an environment in Shipped, select the build, select an environment, and click "Deploy Build". It is that easy!

Once you have selected a build, selected an environment, and clicked "Deploy Build" you will see that Shipped has deployed your build to the environment of your choice.

A url to your deployed build will be displayed in the Shipped UI. You can use this to interact with your deployed project via the web.
