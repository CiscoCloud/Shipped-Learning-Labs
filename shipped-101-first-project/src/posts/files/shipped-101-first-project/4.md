# Step 4. Interacting with Vagrant #

#### Restarting vagrant with our new source files
Lets confirm we are in the the Docker directory where you created your main.go and test.sh file by issuing command "ls".  Now change directory up one more to the project directory by issuing command "cd ..". You should now be at your top level project folder.

Change into a hidden subdirectory called .shipped by issing this command "cd .shipped". Issuing the command "ls" will confirm there is a file called Vagrantfile in this directory.

If you view the Vagrant file by issuing command "cat Vagrantfile" you may see these two lines which affect port mapping. Note port 8888 is the port your golang file is listening on. Port 38888 is the local port being mapped to port 8888 when your application is running in Docker:
        d.ports = ["38888:8888"]
        d.name = "shipped101helloworld"
  	  
To reload Vagrant now that you have added source code to your project, issue the command "Vagrant reload". You will see vagrant reload your project.

Now, to verify it is running properly, execute your test script by issuing the command "../helloworldgoLang/test.sh", followed by the command "echo $?" which shows the most recent exit code. If things are working properly you should see the digit 0, else you should see the digit 2 as the response;

#### Pushing your changes to Shipped

Let's save our changes into GitHub which will cause them to be published to Shipped as well.

Issue the command "cd ../shipped101helloworld" to change to our soucde directory.
Now add all our changes to our git change list by issuing commadn "git add -A"
Then commit them to our local storage by issuing command "git commit"
Now push them up to the GitHub repository and notify Shipped by issuing command "git push origin master"

#### Summary of our progress

To summarize, we have now bootstrapped our local development environment from the url received from Shiped, added our source code and test script, validated it locally in Vagrant and pushed our changes up to GitHub and Shipped.

In our text learning module, we will learn how to validate and deploy our project in Shipped in an interative manner.
