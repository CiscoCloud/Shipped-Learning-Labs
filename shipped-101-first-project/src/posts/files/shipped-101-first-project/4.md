# Step 3 Bootstrap your local development environment

## Open a Terminal Window


We are now going to learn how bootstrap our local development environment.

You will need to have a terminal window open on your local computer. 

* If you do not have an open Terminal window, on a OSX you can press Command + Space to open Spotlight Search. Type Terminal and it will allow you to select the Terminal Application. Double click to open the application. Menu option Shell -> New Window will open a new window for you.

If you are using Microsoft Windows you will want to open a Command Prompt instead.

## Bootstrap your environment

Near the end of the previous example we clicked "Build Project". If it is successful we will be provided with a popup message which is a curl command to pull our project down to our local environment from Shipped. 

The curl command you are to copy from the Shipped UI will look very much like this:

<pre>'"curl 'http://shipped-api.shipped-cisco.com/cli/b56b264b-fa6d-11e4-953e-0242ac11000a/bootstrap?api_token=qIexsFzXzrlcztxcdJJFuyZHRCovgpVv' | bash"</pre></li>

Paste the curl command into this terminal window and press enter.

Here is a summary of the main actions you should see being executed by this command

<pre>Cloning Repositories<br>
Download configs<br>
Install VirtualBox<br>
Install Vagrant<br>
Bootstrap sandbox VM<br>
</pre></li>

Your actual screen output will look something like this as it starts

#### Your new GitHub repository

If you check your repositories on [GitHub](http://github) you will see you have a new repository that matches the name you chose in Shipped. Based on the name I suggested it will be named MyFirstShippedProject. At this time, it will not contain any files. We will create / push those to GitHub next.

#### New files that were downloaded

If you issue the command "ls" from this same terminal window, you will see you now have a directory named the same as the project name you choice in shipped.

Change to that directory and issue the command "ls" again. You will notice you have directory which matches the name of the repository you chose in Shipped. If you followed along closely it will be named shipped101helloworld.

<pre>$ cd MyFirstShippedProject
$ ls<br>
Makefile		shipped101helloworld
</pre></li>


Change into this directory and issue "ls" again. Notice a file named Docker.

<pre>$ cd shipped101helloworld
$ ls<br>
Dockerfile
</pre></li>

Issue the command "cat Dockerfile" and you will see these lines displayed from the file
<pre>$ cat Dockerfile<br>
FROM golang:onbuild
EXPOSE 8888
WORKDIR /go/src/app
CMD ["echo", "noop"]<br></pre></li>

# Adding helloworld app

#### Creating your application main.go file

After verifying you are in the directory that contains the Dockerfile, we are ready to proceed.

Issue command "touch main.go" to create an empty file named main.go
Issue command "vi main.go" to open main.go file in the vi editory

<pre>$ touch main.go
$ vi main.go</pre></li>


Press 'a' key once to enter edit mode
Past this code into your editor

<pre>
package main
 
import(
"fmt"
"net/http"
"runtime"
)
 
func indexHandler( w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){
fmt.Fprintf(w, "hello world, I'm running on %s with an %s CPU ", runtime.GOOS,runtime.GOARCH)
 
}
 
func main(){
http.HandleFunc("/", indexHandler)
http.ListenAndServe(":8888",nil)
}
</pre></li>

Then to save your file and exit the editor, press the 'esc' key once to enter command mode, then press ":wq" to write the file to disk and quite the vi editor.

Lets also create a test script to hit our server. 

Issue command "touch test.sh" to create an empty file named test.sh
Issue command "vi test.sh" to open test.sh file in the vi editory
<pre>$ touch test.sh
$ vi test.sh</pre></li>

Press 'a' key once to enter edit mode
Past this code into your editor. Note: We are intentionally entering port 38888 instead of port 8888 because we will ask Vagrant to map port 38888 on our host to port 8888 on our guest.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

function test {
    res=`curl -s --head $1 | head -n 1 | grep -c 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK'`
    if [ $res -eq 1 ]
    then
    MSG=" OKAY"
    EXIT_CODE=0
    else
    MSG=" NOT OKAY"
    EXIT_CODE=2
    fi
    }

test http://localhost:38888
$(exit $EXIT_CODE)
</pre></li>

Issue command "chmod +x test.sh" to mark this file as a executable script in OSX.
