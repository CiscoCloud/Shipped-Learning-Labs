# Shipped 101: Your First project #

In this Learning Lab you will learn the basics of using Shipped to create and deploy your first cloud based project.

**Platform** 
Shipped supports Mac OS X, Windows 7 or higher, and Ubuntu 13.04 or higher.  This lab was prepared and verified on a MacBook Pro running OS X.

## Objective ##

Completion Time: 30 minutes

* Introduce ourselves to the Shipped UI
* Create, Test, and Submit our fist Shipped Project
* Summarize what we have learned, and talk about what's next
 
## Introducing Shipped UI ##

Shipped is a Cisco Development Portal which provides us with an integrated development environment for creating, building, testing, and deploying into the Cisco Cloud in a continuous integration environment. 

### Create New Project ###

In Shipped, the first thing you are asked to do after logging in is "Create New Project".

A Dialog Box will appear. It will prompt you to enter a Project "Name", and choose "Start Composing" to being selecting the items that will go into the makeup of your project.

## Composing your project

There are many things to choose from as you begin composing your project

### Development Frameworks###

It allows us to quickly create projects from pre-defined development frameworks including

* Ruby on Rails
* GruntJS
* Python
* Golang
* Dropwizard
* ExpressJS
* ASP.Net MVC
* PHP

###Docker Repositories###

Shipped allows you to search Docker Repositories and choose a Docker Image from the results. The Docker image will be added as an additional container in your deployment.

### API ###

Shipped allows you to add specific API sets to your project. CiscoCMX API is supported at this time. It installs with ExpressJS configured in the image.

### Datastores ###

Shipped allows you to search for containerized datastore services such as

* MongoDB
* MySQL
* redis

When you add them to your project, they are added as additional containers to your deployment.

### Message Queues ###

Shipped allows you to search for containerized Message Queue services such as

* Kafka
* sidekiq
* RabbitMQ

When you add them to your project, they are added as additional containers to your deployment.

##Choosing a Repository##

When you first add a Development Framework, Repository, API, or DataStore to your project, you will be prompted for the name of a GitHub Repository for this project.

![](choose_repository.png =400x)

If you begin entering the name of the GitHub Repository for your project, Shipped UI will quickly look up your existing repositories and suggest them them if they match the name you are entering. 

![](enter_repository_name.png =400x)

If you belong to multiple GitHub organizations, this list will be enabled and populated for you.

Also based on your permissions at GitHub, either Private or Public will be enabled. If you have a free account on GitHub you will only be able to create Public repositories.

## Build Project

Once you have added all of the Microservices, and chosen a Repository, it's time to select "Build Project". This will let Shipped know it is time to process your project definition and generate a "Bootstrap" script for you. This bootstrap script can then be executed on your local machine to configure your local development Environment.

![](readytobuild.png =600x)

After you click "Build Project" and a bootstrap script is created for you, you will be prompted with a popup which has a URL you can copy and run in a terminal window.

![](letsgetsetup.png =600x)

When you run the bootstrap script your project will be created in GitHub, and it will be downloaded onto your machine in a directory named after your project.

Within that directory you will find a subdirectory with a Dockerfile representing the image you choose, and a .shipped directory with a Vagrantfile which is used to configure and start your Docker image in VirtualBox.

## Submitting your Project to GitHub

Once you have edited your project, you can submit it back to GitHub. This will trigger Shipped to sync to your newest code, and for it to start a new build of your project.

Switching back to the Shipped UI, you will see details of the project submits to GitHub and a status message for Shipped's attempt to build your project.

## Creating an Environment

Once you have submitted your code back to Shipped, and it has built successfully you will want to create a virtual environment to deploy it into. 

Typically you will create a staging environment to initially deploy it to. Once you have met your ship requirements and have a stable build which has been verified in staging, then you are ready to deploy it to a production environment.

The great thing about Shipped is that your development environment, your staging environment, and your production environment can be virtually the same (no pun intended) thanks to Vagrant, Virtual Box, and Docker!

![](no_environment_created.png =600x)

Initially you will have no environments created. Clicking "Create New Environment" will create one for you. All you do is have to enter the name and description for your environment and click "Add Environment".

![](enter_environment_name.png =600x)

## Deploying Build to Environment

Deploying a build to an environment means that the project you have been working on will be deployed to the environment you select. It will replace any previous deployment of the build to that environment. A staging environment is a good place to practice with.

To deploy a build to an environment in Shipped, select the build, select an environment, and click "Deploy Build". It is that easy!


![](deploy_build_to_environmet.png =600x)

Once you have selected a build, selected an environment, and clicked "Deploy Build" you will see that Shipped has deployed your build to the environment of your choice.

A url to your deployed build will be displayed in the Shipped UI. You can use this to interact with your deployed project via the web.
