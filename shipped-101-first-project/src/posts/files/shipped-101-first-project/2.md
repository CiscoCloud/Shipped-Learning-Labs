# Step 2. Create your first project with Shipped    


# Start Composing

Ensure you have navigted to http://ciscocloud.github.io/shipped/dist/#, that you are signed in, and Select "Create New Project".

Enter your project name and click "Start Composing". For this example I am going to choice MyFirstShippedProject.

# Add Microservices
I am going to choose Golang for my project. I will let the value for Repository be the default (DockerHub). I will then click "Select"

# Choose a Repository
Enter a name for the resository for the Docker image that will be created as a part of this project. I am going to choose shipped101helloworld; As I have a free account on GitHub, my only choice is to choose "Public". I will then click "Add Microservices" to continue; Today I only want to add one microservice so I will continue by choosing "Next Step"

# Add Dependancies
We are also prompted to add dependancies such as Cisco APIs, Datastores, Message Queues, etc. Today will choose to keep it simple and not add any dependancies and we will select 

# Build Project
Choose "Build Project"

### That's it. We have created our first project with Shipped. In the next portion of the lesson, we will 'git' our project to our local machine, make some changes, and push it back to Shipped and GitHub
