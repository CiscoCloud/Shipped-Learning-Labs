# Shipped 101: Your First project #

In this Learning Lab you will learn the basics of using Shipped to create and deploy your first clould based project.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 30 minutes

* Introduce ourselves to the Shipped UI
* Create, Test, and Submit our fist Shipped Project
* Summarize what we have learned, and talk about what's next

**Access to a Macbook Pro running OSX**
* These samples were written and validated on a Macbook Pro running OSX. You don't necessarily need to be running OSX but do need to be running a OS that is compatible with Vagrant, Docker, and Git.     
 
## Introducing Shipped UI ##

Shipped is a Cisco Development Portal which provides us with an intergrated development environment for creating, building, testing, and deploying into the Cisco Clould in a continuous integration environment. 

### Create New Project ###

In Shipped, the first thing you are asked to do after logging in is "Create New Project".

###Docker Repositories###

Shipped allows you to search Docker Repositories and choose a Docker Image from the results. The Docker image will be added as an additional container in your deployment.

Shipped allows you to add specific API sets to your project. CiscoCMX API is supported at this time. It installs with ExpressJS configured in the image.

### Datastores ###

Shipped allows you to search for containerized datastore services such as

* MongoDB
* MySQL

Shipped allows you to search for containerized Message Queue services such as

* Kafka
* sidekiq

##Choosing a Repository##

When you first add a Development Framework, Repository, API, or DataStore to your project, you will be prompted for the name of a GitHub Repository for this project.

If you begin entering the name of the GitHub Repository for your project, Shipped UI will quickly look up your existing repositories and suggest them them if they match the name you are entering.

If you belong to multiple GitHub organizations, this list will be enabled and populated for you.

Also based on your permissions at GitHub, either Private or Public will be enabled.
