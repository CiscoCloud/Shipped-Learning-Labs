# Explore and Modify the CMX Demo Application

### Step 9 Explore the CMX Demo Application

Navigate to the local deployment of the CMX demo application ([http://localhost:33000](http://localhost:33000)).  This shows the application loging page

By default, the CMX Server address is grayed out and the Virtualize checkbox is checked. When virtualization is active, the server fills requests from files in the server/testData directory.  This allows you to run the application without requiring a CMX server, and with consistent and predictable responses to all API requests.

The User Name and Password collected on the login form are credentials for the CMS server, and are not used when virtualization is active (although they are still required fields on the login form).  Leave them at their default of learning/learning and press Submit.  The application displays the map:

The map shows the convention room floor with a yellow dot and the user name at the point where each user is currently located.  This allows you to see what interests your users right now.  You can also see the history of where each user was in the past.  Clicking on user Steve shows his previous locations:

The application is written to show only the last ten locations that were at least 60 seconds apart.  You can change this configuration by modifying source file ui/cmxmap.js in the repository directory.  In the next step, we'll show you how to make changes and update the application.  For now, continue exploring the application by pressing Show List of All Users.  The application shows you a text list of all users:

![](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/Shipped-Learning-Labs/blob/master/shipped-102-cmx-project/src/posts/files/shipped-102-cmx-project/cmx_sample_app_alluser_list.png)

On this form, you can click on a user's name to display that user's location history, or click on a map name to display the map of all users in the room.

Up to now, we've been looking at virtualized data.  The next step is to connect to a real CMX server.  To do this, click on the Logout button in the upper right to display the login form and then uncheck the Virtualize checkbox.  The application enables the CMX Server field and fills it in with a default value:

The default server address (https://64.103.26.61:8081) is a CMX demo server supported by Cisco that supplies simulated data for testing.  The default user name and password of learning/learning is supported on this server.  If you have your own CMX server available, you can enter its address in the CMX Server field, along with a valid user name and password.  Then press Submit.  The application shows the map, this time filled with data from a real CMX server:

![](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/Shipped-Learning-Labs/blob/master/shipped-102-cmx-project/src/posts/files/shipped-102-cmx-project/cmx_sample_app_alluser_map_real_data.png)

The map shows many more users, each identified with their MAC address.  If you use your own server, you will see normal user names.  Aside from the names, the application functions identically with real or virtualized data.

### Step 10 Modify the Demo Application

Shipped creates a development environment allowing you to modify deployed applications to your requirements.  Let's try a simple change.  File ui/index.html specifies the login form for the demo application.  Bring this up in a text editor and make a small change.   For example,  you could change the application name in the top bar (currently "CMX Client Locator on Shipped").  This name is specified in the third line of the <body> section, approximately the 18th line of the file.  Edit it to be "My CMX Client Locator on Shipped" and save the file.

To update the demo application, issue the following commands:

    cd ..
    make run

These commands cause Shipped to rebuild the deployment.  This takes less than a minute, during which you'll see a number of messages similar to those you saw when the bootstrap process was creating your deployment.  Now if the navigate to the application, you'll see your change:

![](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/Shipped-Learning-Labs/blob/master/shipped-102-cmx-project/src/posts/files/shipped-102-cmx-project/cmx_sample_app_login_modified.png)

To deploy this change to the production application running in the cloud, just commit the updated files to GitHub.  This automatically starts a build that you can redeploy by following Steps 7 and 8 of this tutorial.

Welcome to Shipped!
