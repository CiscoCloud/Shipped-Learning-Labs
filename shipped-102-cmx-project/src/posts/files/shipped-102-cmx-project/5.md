# Explore the Development Environment

### Step 9 Explore the Source Repository

Your new source repository is in directory *projectName/repoName*. If you used the names suggested in this tutorial, this will be shipped-cmx-demo/shipped-cmx-demo-repo.  The command you ran in Step 7 should have changed the directory in your terminal window to this; if not, change to it manually.

Once you're in the repository directory, Use the dir command (Windows) or the ls -lu command (Mac and Linux) to list the contents of the repository:

Here's what you see in the directory:

File or Directory | Significance
----------------- | ------------
.drone.yml | A control file for [Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone), the continuous integration build server that Shipped uses
.gitignore | A control file for Git naming local files that should not be committed to the cloud
bin | A directory containing Linux shell scripts for building and running the application. These run in Drone's Linux VM, so they're used even in Windows.
Dockerfile | A control file for Docker specifying how to deploy the CMX application in a Docker container.
Makefile | Used by Drone to manipulate the application environment
node_modules | The directory created by NodeJS containing third-party Node packages used by the CMX demo application
package.json | A configuration file listing the third-party Node packages used by the CMX demo application
README.md | A [markdown file](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) documenting the CMX demo application and its REST API. GitHub automatically converts this file to HTML and displays it on the main page of the shipped-cmx-demo-repo repository.
server | A directory containing the Node source for the CMX demo application server
ui | A directory containing the HTML and JavaScript files implementing the CMX demo application web interface

To continue development, update the source code and use Git commands to commit your changes to the repository that Shipped created for you.  A build starts automatically each time you commit changes.  You can repeat steps 7 and 8 as often as you like until the application is tailored to your own requirements.

### Step 10 Use Vagrant to Manage the Development Environment

Vagrant is the open source application that Shipped uses to manage your development environment.  Shipped creates two VMs for the CMX demo application, both using a VirtualBox hypervisor.  One hosts a Docker server and the other hosts a Docker container that runs the CMX demo application server.  This is background information; you won't normally need to access either Docker or VirtualBox directly, as Shipped has set this all up for you.  However, there are a few Vagrant commands you may find useful to manage the environment.

The Vagrant home directory is *projectName*/.shipped.  Issue the following commands to review the status of the VMs in your development environment:

    cd ../.shipped
    vagrant status

Vagrant responds by listing the status of the two VMs in your environment:

    Current machine states:
    
    dockerhost-9c32ee18-0b93-11e5-b118-0242ac11066d running (virtualbox)
    shipped_cmx_demo_repo   running (docker)
    
    This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
    above with their current state. For more information about a specific
    VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.

In this case, you can see the two machine names are **dockerhost-9c32ee18-0b93-11e5-b118-0242ac11066d** and **shipped_cmx_demo_repo**.  You'll use these names in some of the commands in the table below.  The table lists some useful Vagrant commands.  You must be in the .shipped directory to use them.

Vagrant Command | Purpose
--------------- | -------
vagrant destroy | Shut down and destroy the environment.  Use vagrant up to recreate it.
vagrant docker-logs | List CMX application logs from the demo machine
vagrant halt [*machineName*] | Stop a single machine or the entire environment. A halted machine must be rebooted to start up again.  Use vagrant up to reboot.
vagrant ssh *machineName* | Start a terminal session on *machineName*.  You can use Linux commands to explore the machine.
vagrant status  | List names and status of all machines
vagrant status *machineName* | List status of machine *machineName*
vagrant suspend [*machineName] | Suspend a single or all machines in the environment.  A suspended machine consumes no resources other than disk space, and can be brought back up in the exact state it was in when suspended.  Use vagrant up to resume.
vagrant up | Start the entire environment.  Vagrant up recreates destroyed machines, reboots halted machines, and resumes suspended machines.

For more detail on these and other commands, see online [Vagrant Command Line Interface documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html).
