# Create Your CMX Project with Shipped    


### Step 3 Compose Your CMX Project ###

Use any modern browser (we recommend Chrome) to navigate to the the [Shipped welcome page](http://ciscocloud.github.io/shipped/dist/#).  If you're not logged, click on the big green "Sign up with GitHub" button to login.  If this is your first project, Shipped automatically pops up a Create New Project form; if not, select Create New Project from the Your Projects dropdown to get the popup:

Enter a name for your project (we'll use "shipped-cmx-demo" for this tutorial) and press Start Composing.  Shipped displays a list of development services:

The development services listed are examples of what Shipped calls "microservices" - supporting services used by a project.  We can choose as many microservices as needed for a project.  Shipped installs whatever is needed to deploy the selected microservices on one of the VMs it creates for you.  For your CMX project, you'll need an API microservice, so click on the APIs tab under Compose Your Project to display the list of APIs:

The first API on the list is the CiscoCMX API you'll need for your project.  Click on the Select button to the right of this API.  Shipped pops up the Service Configuration form that you'll use to specify the GitHub repository where Shipped will store the source code using the service:

This form allows you to specify:

Field  | Significance | Value in This Tutorial
------------- | ------------- |-------------
Name of GitHub Repository  | The name of the GitHub repository where Shipped stores the source code using this service.  Shipped automatically creates the repository if necessary. | shipped-cmx-demo-repo
GitHub Organization|The GitHub account owning the repository.  This can be your personal account, or the account of a company or organization associated with your account.|*your personal account*
Private Public|The type of repository to create: private (available only to specific GitHub users) or public (viewable by any web user).  You need a paid GitHub account to create a private repository.|Public

Specify "shipped-cmx-demo-repo" for the repository name and press Add Service.  Shipped re-displays the Compose Your Project form with the repository name for the selected service above the Build Project button.

### Step 4. Build Your Project

To build your project, press the Build Project button.  The button label changes to Building, and a status bar moves across the button while Shipped creates your GitHub repository and stores the description of your project in its database.  When it's finished, it pops up the Let's Get Set Up form containing the command to bootstrap the project on your computer:

You've now created your CMX project in Shipped. The next step is to download the project to your local machine and complete the setup of your cloud-based development environment.  Shipped calls this bootstrapping the project, and it's the next step in this tutorial.
