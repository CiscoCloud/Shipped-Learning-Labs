# Shipped - Delete an Environment 

Deleting an environment removes the environment and  the deployed container for services in the project. For example, deleting the "Production" environment deletes the namespace AND the running containers for this environment.

Deleting an environment is permanent and can't be undone.



## Delete an Environment using the UI

1. From the Deploy tab, next to the environment you want to delete, click **Settings**.

3. Type the name of the environment, then click **Delete Environment**.
