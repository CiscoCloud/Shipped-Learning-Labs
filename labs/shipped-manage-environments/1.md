# Shipped - Managing Environments
Environments are used to distinguish different deployment scenarios. Environments are where you can build your project.

Some commonly used environments are:

- Build
- Testing
- Staging
- Production

You can create multiple environments, but you need at least one environment to build your app. When you create an environment, Shipped also creates a configuration for each service and a default deploy target.

Within the Shipped Console:

To create an environment, use *create* and provide the project ID and name. The description is optional.
