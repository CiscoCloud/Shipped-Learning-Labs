    The Shipped UI opens.

You can now run Shipped in three ways:

1. UI - the easiest method and works on all platforms, although Chrome is recommended.
2. API - usually for scripting and advanced users.
3. CLI - within a Terminal window (Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows), navigate to your project directory and type <code>shipped console</code>. Enter the CLI commands from there.

**Note**: Refer to the related Learning Labs for each of these methods.
