	The Shipped UI opens.

You can now run Shipped in three ways:

1. the UI - the easiest method and works on all platforms, although Chrome is recommended.
2. the API - usually for scripting and advanced users.
3. the CLI - within a Terminal window (Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows), navigate to your project directory and type <code>shipped console</code>. Enter the CLI commands from there.

Specific actions for each of these methods is described in the related Learning Labs.
