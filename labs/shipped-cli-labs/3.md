# Shipped - Local Bootstrap


One of the most important features of Shipped is the ability to import a project and its services to your local machine. Bootstrapping a project creates a local Git repository for each of its services that is linked to the remote GitHub repository that Shipped created when you created the service. The local repository is in a directory on your local machine and the remote repository is in the cloud.

1. Change to the directory where you want to place the project and service.
 
1. Issue the <code>local bootstrap</code> command, and provide the name of the project to be bootstrapped. You can add the <code>--fast</code> flag to speed up the bootstrap process by skipping VM and container deployment. 

        shipped lcl bootstrap TestProject --fast 
**Note**: You can abbreviate any commands by truncating them to the minimum length necessary for unambiguous specification. 

    Shipped provides detailed output of the bootstrap progress:

## View Service Logs

Most services write logs while they are running. Issue the **local logs** command, and provide the names of the project and service to be viewed.
