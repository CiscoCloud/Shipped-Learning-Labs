## Builds
Pushing any change to the remote GitHub repository automatically starts a build, which takes a few minutes to complete.  Since Shipped pushes a couple of changes as part of the normal process of service creation, the first build for your new service is already running.  You can use the `build get` command to watch this build and display its logs on completion:

    shipped build get --latest --logs --watch 10

In this command, the `--latest` argument tells the CLI to get the most recent build; `--logs` tells it to display logs upon completion; and `--watch 10` tells it to wait up to 10 minutes for build completion.  Shipped responds with the message:

    Watching for build 1 completion....

and appends a dot to it every 15 seconds to let you know it's still watching.   When the build completes, Shipped displays its logs and the status of the build:
