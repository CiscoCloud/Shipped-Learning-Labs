One of the most important features of Shipped is the ability to import a project and its services to your local developer machine.  On your local machine, you can review and modify a service's source code, including committing it to a GitHub repository.  In addition, you can build and test a service in a VM that Shipped can create for you on local machine.  The CLI `local` command includes a number of subcommands for working with locally deployed projects and services.  To see a list of them, enter the command:

    shipped help local
 
## Local Bootstrap
You use the `local bootstrap` command to import a project and its services and set up a local VM.  To do this, change to the directory where you want to place the project and services and issue the command:

    shipped local bootstrap demo

In this case, **demo** is the name of the project you created in the <a href="2.md">previous section</a>. 

Bootstrap may take a few minutes, with the time depending on the number of services and the buildpacks they use.  Shipped provides detailed output of the progress of bootstrap:

    git 2.7.2 is already installed.

    ============================================================
    Bootstrap is complete and Shipped has set up a CI build for each of your services.
    To initiate a build for a service, do a git commit and push for that service.

## Verify
The last few lines of bootstrap output show the status of services deployed in the local VM.  The output above shows that Shipped successfully deployed service `goservice` to the local VM and that it has a web service available at the URL http://localhost:38891 (even though the service is running in a VM, its web services are exposed through a port on your local machine).  To verify the service is running, copy and paste the URL from the service status report into a browser window and press Enter.   The browser shows the service's output:

## Service Logs and Status
Most services write logs while they are running.  You can review a service's logs with the `local logs` command:

    shipped local logs Demo goservice

Shipped responds:

    Logs for service goservice:
    Example app listening at http://localhost:8888
    OK

The port shown in the sample log is that used within the VM running the service, which is all that the service knows about.  This port is mapped to a different port in your development machine, which is the one shown in the status report displayed at the end of bootstrap.  You can retrieve this report at any time with the `local status` command:

    shipped local status

Shipped responds with the same information it shows at the end of bootstrap:

    1 service is running and is available at the web address below
    ------------  ------------  --------------    ------         -------------------
    Service Name  Container ID  Container Name    Status         Service Web Address
    ------------  ------------  --------------    ------         -------------------
    goservice     5fd7068061c6  demo_goservice_1  Up 28 minutes  http://localhost:38891
