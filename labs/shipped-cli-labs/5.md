# Shipped - Deploy Build

Deploying a build means to make its service available in the cloud.  The first step is to create an environment that contains a set of deployable configurations. For example, you may want to create "Production" and "Test" environments for a service with different scaling requirements and resource allocation.

## Create Environment

1. Issue the `environment create` command, and provide the name of the project and the name for the new environment, as well as an optional description.

    Example:

        shipped env create TestProject name=testenv description="This is test env"

1. Issue the `build deploy` command, and provide the names of the project, service, and environment to be deployed. You can add the `--latest` flag to get the most recent build. 

    Example:

        shipped builds deploy testproject testservice testenv --latest

    Respond:

    Note that a blank status indicates that the deployment is in progress.

1. Issue the `release get` command to watch for completion of deployment.  A deployed build is called a release. The `--latest` flag tells the CLI to get the most recent release; and --watch 10 tells it to wait up to 10 minutes for release to be deployed. 

    Example: 

        shipped release get testproject testenv --latest --watch 10
