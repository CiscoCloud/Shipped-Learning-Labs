## Modify Service and Reload
During bootstrap, Shipped creates both a local repository containing a service's source code and a VM for building and running the service.  The local directory containing the source code is shared with the VM, so that any changes you make there are available to the VM.  This makes it easy to build and test your changes.

To see this, change to the service directory and edit file main.go.  Look for the line containing the string "Hello from Cisco Shipped!" and change "Cisco Shipped" to your own name.  Then issue the command:

    shipped local reload Demo goservice

Shipped stops the service, rebuilds it, and restarts it, showing progress with a series of messages:

    Halt for service goservice:
    demo_goservice_1
    Build for service goservice:

    1 service is running and is available at the web address below

Like bootstrap, reload output ends with a service status report.  Copy and paste the URL shown under Service Web Address into a browser to verify the updated service reflects your changes.

## Redeploying
Once you're satisfied with the changed service, you can redeploy it to the cloud.  To do so, repeat the steps in the previous sections:
