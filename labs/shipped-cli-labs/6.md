# Shipped - Modify Service and Reload


During bootstrap, Shipped creates both a local repository that contains a service's source code and a VM for building and running the service. The local directory containing the source code is shared with the VM, so that any changes you make there are available to the VM. This makes it easy to build and test your changes.

1. Issue the `local reload` command, and provide the name of the project to be reloaded. 

    Example:

        shipped lcl reload testproject

    Shipped stops the service, rebuilds it, and restarts it.

1. Redeploy the service to the cloud.
