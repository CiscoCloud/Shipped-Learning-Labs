# Shipped - Build

On your local machine, you can review and modify a service's source code, and commit it to a GitHub repository. In addition, you can build and test a service in a VM that Shipped creates for your local machine. 

1. Issue the `build get` command to watch the build and display its logs on completion. 
 
    You can add flags to the command: The `--latest` flag tells the CLI to get the most recent build; `--logs` tells it to display logs upon completion; and `--watch 10` tells it to wait up to 10 minutes for build completion.

    Example:

        shipped build get testproject --latest --logs --watch 10
