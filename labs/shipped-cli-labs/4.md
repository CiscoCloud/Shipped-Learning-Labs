# Shipped - Local Bootstrap

Local - Local [desktop] development environment management
----------------------------------------------------------
Each service in a project runs in its own Docker container, with the containers hosted in a Docker host VM. A service's
local source repository is shared with its container, so that changes you make on your desktop are available to the
container.  You build, run, and test your code in the container, while maintaining it on your desktop.
