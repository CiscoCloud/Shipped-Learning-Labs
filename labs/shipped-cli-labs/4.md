# Shipped - Commit and Build



On your local machine, you can review and modify a service's source code, and commit it to a GitHub repository. In addition, you can build and test a service in a VM that Shipped creates for your local machine. After making changes on your local machine, you need to commit and push them to the remote repository. Pushing changes to the remote GitHub repository automatically starts a build.  

1. Issue a `local commit` command, and provide the names of the project and service to be committed, as well as an optional message. 

    Example:

        shipped lcl commit testproject testservice message="Sipped Build" 

    Respond:

       ![](posts/files/shipped-cli-labs/assets/local-commit.png)

1. Issue the `build get` command to watch the build and display its logs on completion. 
 
    You can add flags to the command: The `--latest` flag tells the CLI to get the most recent build; `--logs` tells it to display logs upon completion; and `--watch 10` tells it to wait up to 10 minutes for build completion.

    Example:

        shipped build get testproject --latest --logs --watch 10

    Respond:
