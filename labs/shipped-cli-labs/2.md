# Shipped - Create Application and Service

## Access CLI

1. Open a command window. 

1. Enter shipped **help -t xxx**, where xxx is the token you copied earlier.

    Shipped displays an overview help information. 

<a name="create"></a>
## Create an Application
Shipped groups services into applications. You create an application with the <code>project create</code> command, and provide a name and optional description for the application.

Example:

    shipped project create name=testProject description="A Demo Application"

Shipped echoes the project name and description.

    Changed to new project directory c:\shipped\Demo
    Application  Description
    -------      -----------
    testProject	 A Demo Application

## Create a Service

A service is an independently deployable component of a project. Most services are based on a buildpack that includes starter code for the service. You can list buildpacks with the command:

1. Issue the <code>buildpack getall</code> command to see a list of available buildpacks.
 
    Example: 

        shipped buildpack

    Shipped shows the available buildpacks.

1. Issue the <code>service create</code> command, and provide the name of the project, the name of the buildpack to use, and the name for the new service.

    Example: 

        shipped service create testProject golang name=testservice
