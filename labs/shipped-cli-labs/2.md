# Shipped - Create an Application

To use the Shipped CLI to create an application, you need to:

- Sign up with GitHub
- Authorize Shipped to create a GitHub repository on your behalf
- Obtain an API token to identify yourself to Shipped

## Sign up with GitHub

1. In a browser, go to [http://ciscoshipped.io/](http://ciscoshipped.io/).

1. Click **Sign up with GitHub**.

    The GitHub site opens in your browser.

## Provide Authorization to Shipped

1. Click **Authorize application** to allow Shipped to read your public data. You only need to do this the first time you use Shipped.

    The Shipped UI opens.

## Obtain an API Token 

1. Click your user name and select **My Profile** from the drop-down list.

1. Click **Show My User Token**. 

    ![](posts/files/shipped-cli-labs/assets/token.png)

1. Copy this token. 

## Access CLI

1. Open a command window. 

1. Enter shipped **help -t xxx**, where xxx is the API token you copied earlier.

    Shipped displays an overview help information. 

    **Note**: Shipped stores your API token. You do not need to provide this token again. 

You are now ready to use the Shipped CLI.

## CLI Command and Help Overview

Shipped CLI commands typically take the form:

    shipped command subcommand arguments

where command is the Shipped object you want to work with (such as "application" or "service"), subcommand is what you want to do with it (such as "create" or "list"), and arguments vary depending on the command and subcommand. You can abbreviate command, subcommand, and arguments by truncation to the minimum length necessary for non-ambiguity.

To obtain help for a command or subcommand, either use the help command or include a `-h` or `--help` argument anywhere in the command. For example, to obtain help for the `project create` command, type any of the following:

    shipped help project create
    shipped project create -h
    shipped proj cr --help

The last example also is an example of abbreviating a commands and subcommand.

Additional CLI documentation is available online at [https://developer.cisco.com/site/shipped/documents/cli-guide/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/shipped/documents/cli-guide/).

## Create a Application
Shipped groups services into projects.  You can create a project by providing its name and and an optional description: 

    shipped project create name=Demo desc="A Demo Application"

Shipped shows successful completion by echoing the project name and description.

    Changed to new project directory c:\shipped\Demo
    Application  Description
    -------  -----------
    Demo	 A Demo Application



<a name="service"></a>
## Create a Service
A service is an independently deployable component of a project. Most services are based on a buildpack that includes starter code for the service. You can list buildpacks with the command:

    shipped buildpack list

Shipped shows the available buildpacks:

    BuildPack
    ---------
    golang
    Cisco Tropo WebAPI
    CiscoCMX API
    Cisco APICEM
    ExpressJS
    Java Spring Boot
    Python
    Cisco Spark
    Dropwizard
    Grunt.JS
    Ruby on Rails
    PHP


To create a service, provide the name of the project you just created, the name of the buildpack you want to use, and the name of the new service.  For example, to create a service using the Go language, use the command:

    shipped services create demo golang name="goservice"

Once again, Shipped shows successful completion by echoing service information.

    Service    BuildPack  Application
    -------    ---------  -------
    goservice  golang     Demo

When you create a service, Shipped automatically creates a GitHub repository for its source code and sets up a CI build so that any push you make to the repository automatically causes a build.  We'll see how to use these in subsequent sections.
