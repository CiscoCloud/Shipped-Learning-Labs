# Shipped - Managing Users
A User is anyone with access to the deployed project. When you create a project, you are automatically designated a User, although you are the only one. You can add as many users as you want.


Add users by sending an Invite Token, which they receive by email. When they respond, Shipped  automatically adds them as users.

4. Enter user email addresses. You can enter as many email addresses as you need.
5. Click **Invite Users**.

Emails are sent to each user with unique token numbers. When they respond, they are then able to log into the project.


## Add a User using the API

You can create an invite token for single or multiple email addresses. This endpoint sends the invites to these addresses.

	curl 'https://api.ciscoshipped.io/invite_tokens' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"project_id":"34a35726-66e9-11e5-99df-0242ac110120","emails":["mikejihbe@gmail.com"]}'


HTTP Request:

	POST https://api.ciscoshipped.io/invite_tokens


Shipped accepts an invite by resolving an invite token. If authenticated, Shipped adds the current user to the project; otherwise,  instructs the client to redirect to the authentication view.

	curl 'https://api.ciscoshipped.io/invite_tokens/c490939f-66ff-11e5-9de2-0242ac110121'


HTTP Request:

	GET https://api.ciscoshipped.io/invite_tokens/<INVITE_TOKEN>
