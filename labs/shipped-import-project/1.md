To Integrate your project with shipped you need to have Docker file. this docker file content varies depend on your project requirement.

2 Create a Docker file- This section is specific to the type of project (this project is in Golang)

For Example:
```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.5 # Base Image for Golang Project types.
EXPOSE 8888     # Port number to expose from docker container to host server.
WORKDIR /go/src/app  # Workspace directory path where your code exists
COPY . /go/src/app   # Copy source from host machine to docker container.

 # Run your build/Run or test script.
RUN ["go build"]
CMD ./Binary_file_name
```
