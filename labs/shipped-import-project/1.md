# Shipped - Create a Dockerfile

If you are starting your development and a new git project, you can fork the sample Go code using this link <a href="https://github.com/CiscoCloud/shipped-buildpack-template-golang#fork-destination-box">https://github.com/CiscoCloud/shipped-buildpack-template-golang#fork-destination-box</a>. When your git repo is ready with the *golang hellow-world* source code, you can start importing to this repository. 

1. Select your git repo to integrate with Shipped. 

    This example shows *goproject*, a project written in golang.

1. Create a Dockerfile that is specific to the type of project.

    A Dockerfile is required to integrate your project with Shipped and its content depends on your project requirement.

    The following example shows a Dockerfile for Golang.

	
		#Base Image for Golang Project
		FROM golang:1.5
		#Port Number to expose from docker container to host server
		EXPOSE 8888
		#Working directory path where your code exists
		WORKDIR /go/src/app
		#Copy source from host machine to docker container
		COPY . /go/src/app
		#Adding permission to access .shipped folder
		RUN chmod a+x .shipped/build .shipped/run .shipped/test
		#provide your build/run commands
		RUN [".shipped/build"]
		CMD .shipped/run


1. Add your Dockerfile to your existing repository.
