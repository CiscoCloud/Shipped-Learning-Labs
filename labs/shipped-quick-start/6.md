# Interact with Vagrant #

1. Confirm you are in the Docker directory.

		$ ls
		Dockerfile	main.go	

2. Go up one level to the parent directory.

		$ cd ..

3. Change into the hidden subdirectory *.shipped*, then get the list of files. Confirm the Vagrantfile is in this directory.

		$ cd .shipped
		$ ld
		Vagrantfile

4. View the contenst of Vagrantfile and notice the port mapping.

		$ cat Vagrantfile

Port 8888 is what your golang file is listening on. Port 38888 is the local port being mapped to port 8888 when your application is running in Docker:
        d.ports = ["38888:8888"]
        d.name = "shipped101helloworld"
  	  
5. After adding source code to your project, reload Vagrant.

		$ vagrant reload

6. Verify your application is running, open a browser to

		http://localhost:38888. 

	You should see "Hello from Cisco Shipped!"

7. To stop the virtual machine, issue the command:

		$ vagrant halt
