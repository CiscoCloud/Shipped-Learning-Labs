# Building your First Project

You are now redirected to the dashboard tab, showing the events of your project. At the backend, Shipped creates a GitHub repository and adds a few project-related files to it.

1. Go to your GitHub account and search for **goHelloWorld** repo.


2. View the project folder; Shipped adds a private repo to Drone to build your project.  
    **Note**: Shipped adds the **.shipped** folder and the following files that are responsible for building and running your project: **Drone.sec**, **Drone.yml**, and **Dockerfile**.

3. Click the **Build** tab and observe the progress of your first build.  
    The build logs appear on the right and the build status on the left. The project is in the **In-Progress** state as indicated by the yellow circle.

    When your build status changes to the **Passed** status (indicated by the green circle), your first build is ready to deploy.

    **Note**: If the build status is "Failed," see details on the right and verify that your project code is buildable.
