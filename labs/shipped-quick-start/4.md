# Using Environments

Environments are virtual places to deploy your project. You can have as many environments as you want, and they can be the same as each other, or not.

For example, you might want a *Development* environment for developers to continue working on your application. The *Staging* environment is a good place for testing, while the *Production* environment could be a verified stable build.

1. From the **Deploy** tab, click **Create a new environment**.

2. Enter a name any way you want and an optional description, then click **Save**.

3. Select the environment and build, click **Deploy Build**.  
	Deploying a build to an environment means that your project will be deployed to the environment you select. It replaces any previous deployment of the build to that environment.

    **Note**: New builds are automatically triggered when a new commit is pushed to the project folder; therefore, make sure to deploy the "right" build. In this example, there is only a single build option, so it is selected by default.

4.  Observe the progress bar (below the Environment) while the deployment is in progress.

    The progress bar disappears when the project deployment is completed; a URL in green link appears (such as "CISCO EU" for the build).

**Congratulation!** You have successfully built and deployed your first project.

## Summary

You have bootstrapped a generic shipped project, you have created an environment and deployed a build successfully.
