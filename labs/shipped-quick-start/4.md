# Using Environments

Environments are virtual places to deploy your project. You can have as many environments as you want, and they can be the same as each other, or not.

For example, you might want a *Development* environment for developers to continue working on your application. The *Staging* environment is a good place for testing, while the *Production* environment could be a verified stable build.

You can name your environments any way you want.

1. From the Deploy tab, click **Create a new Environment**.

3. Our First Environment is ready, Kindly make sure environment and build is selected. 

    Note: To our project folder in github as we do new commit to project folder, automatically new builds get triggered. So you have to make sure which build you need to deploy.
    
    In our case we have only single option for build, which is by default selected. So click on **Deploy Build**. 

	Deploying a build to an environment means that your project will be deployed to the environment you select. It replaces any previous deployment of the build to that environment.

4.  Deployment is in progress. We can see progress bar below the Environment.

5. When the project deployment is completed, we can see URL in green color link like "CISCO EU" for    the build, and progress bar also disappears.
