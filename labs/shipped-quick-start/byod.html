To work on this lab on your own machine, you will need to a machine and operating system compatible with <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, and <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/End-user_documentation">Virtual Box</a>.
Shipped supports Mac OS X, Windows 7 or higher, and Ubuntu 13.04 or higher.  We strongly recommend using one of these operating systems when using Shipped.  Although any modern browser should work with Shipped, we recommend Chrome for the best experience.
