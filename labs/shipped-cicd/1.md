# Shipped - Configure CI CD

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that code is checked into a shared repository frequently. The frequent integration enables you to quickly identify and correct code errors, allowing you to deliver software more rapidly. 
Using CI software tools, such as Go, you can automate the testing and build a document trail.

Continuous Deployment (CD) is a practice that closely related to CI. CD deploys the software directly into production that passes the automated tests. By implementing both CI and CD, you not only reduce risks and catch bugs quickly, but also move rapidly to working software.
