# Shipped - Configure CI CD

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that code is checked into a shared repository frequently. The frequent integration enables you to quickly identify and correct code errors, allowing you to deliver software more rapidly. 
Using CI software tools, such as Go, you can automate the testing and build a document trail.

Continuous Deployment (CD) is a practice that closely related to CI. CD deploys the software directly into production that passes the automated tests. By implementing both CI and CD, you not only reduce risks and catch bugs quickly, but also move rapidly to working software.


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you need to build a project, commit it to git, and deploy it to the environment.

**Note to Vijay: I don't know where you got the "Global Configurations" screen**


Global Configurations

Deployment Target Specific Configurations.

Note : If we change any of the configuration setting here like CPU count, Update Enviroment Variables we need to redeploy our successfull build.

3 Once done with Enviroment specific setting, We need to redeploy build.

Deploying a build to an environment means that your project will be deployed to the environment you select. It replaces any previous deployment of the build to that environment.

4 When the project deployment is completed, we can see URL in green color link like "CISCO EU" for    the build, and progress bar also disappears.

Wow, You have successfully built and deployed your project with custom environment settings.






2 Add a new Service (Golang for Eg.), you can select from existing buildpacks.
