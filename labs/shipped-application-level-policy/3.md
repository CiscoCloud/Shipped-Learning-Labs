We have defined rule, which signifies that if Memory Use is greater then 75% then Scale Up the container from 1 to 2, and again, if again memory use is greater than 75% with in 2 container it will Scale up by 1 from 2 to 3 container. As we defined 3 as maximum limit so from here it will not scale up.

Lets create another policy with different condition.

Policy Explanation :

We are trying to set alaram on memory use, If Mem Use is Greater then 75% then trigger the alaram.

We can scale the percentage by moving green dot with in the spider web as show in below .

We have two set of dots, Inner green dots (highlighted) to set the minimum threshold. and Outer green dots (highlighted) to set the maximum threshold value.

As we move dots you can see that policy that we have added, value will auto update.

So let save it and go back to environment.
