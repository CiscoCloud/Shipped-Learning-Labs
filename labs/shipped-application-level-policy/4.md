We can specify the no of MB's by which we can start memory leak in app to see how policy response to our app.

So we are adding 2 and click on update button, once done we will click on resume (it resume app with memory leak.)

As we can see memory leak has been increasing. As Memory leak reached 75% of policy, we will get alert, in shipped ui.

We can see alert under Run page >
