# Create a Project using the UI

1. Within the Shipped UI, go to **My Projects > Create New Project**.

	The **Create Your Project** form opens.

	<video poster="assets/create-project.png" width="480" height="300" none controls> <source src="assets/shipped-new-project.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

2. Enter a name for your project, then click **Start Composing**.

	A project name can only consist of letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, but no spaces.

	Shipped builds some basic components, then shows the **Compose Your Project** page.

3. Click **Start from a Buildpack**, then select **Dropwizard**.

	This lab shows one example, but you can build a project from any buildpack listed.

	The **Dropwizard** form opens.

5. Click **Build Project**.

	Follow the instructions shown in the UI, copying and pasting the commands into the local directory you want to use for your Shipped project.

	This example shows a project created in Windows.

	If using windows, install the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases"  target="_blank">Git Credential Manager for Windows</a> into the Shipped directory.

	Shipped automatically downloads and installs apps needed for your project. This might take a couple of minutes.
