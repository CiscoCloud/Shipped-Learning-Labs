# How to use Sample Application
You need an <code>auth token</code> to access the sample application. 

 1. Log in to <a href="https://developer.ciscospark.com/" target="_blank">developer spark</a> to retrieve the token.  
     When the application is up and running, the following screen appears.

    After adding a valid token to application, the sample app fetches all rooms associated with that token.
